[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://code.google.com/soc/) is a program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects. Google will be working with several open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund several projects over a three month period.

Please note that to apply for GSoC, you will need to go through the standard [Google Summer of Code application process](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), selecting Mono Project as the organization. You do not apply directly to the Mono Project. Any questions or comments about this program can be sent to soc@xamarin.com.
