As part of our ongoing efforts to improve Mono's profiling infrastructure, in
Mono 5.6, we will be shipping an overhaul of Mono's profiler API. This is the
part of Mono's embedding API that deals with instrumenting managed programs for
the purpose of collecting data regarding allocations, CPU usage, code coverage,
and other data produced at runtime.

The old API had some limitations that prevented some features and
capabilities from being implemented.   The upgrade to the API will allow us to:

* Reconfigure the profiling features at runtime
* Look at the values of incoming parameters and return values.
* Ability to instrument the managed allocators, thus allowing these to be profiled.

This is what we did.

Reconfigure Profiling at Runtime
--------------------------------

We wanted the ability to reconfigure the profiling option at runtime.
This was not possible with the old API because none of the API
functions took an argument representing the profiler whose options
should be changed.

This means that it was only possible to change options of the most
recently installed profiler, and this was not guaranteed to be the one you
wanted.   Additionally, doing so it was not thread safe.

Why would we want to change profiling options at runtime, you might
wonder?  Suppose you know that only a particular area of your program
has performance issues and you're only interested in data gathered
while your program is executing that code.  With this capability, you
can turn off profiling features such as allocations and statistical
sampling until you get to the point you want to profile, and then turn
them on programmatically. This can significantly reduce the noise
caused by unneeded data in a profiling session.

Call Context Introspection
--------------------------

Call context introspection allows a profiler to instrument the
prologue and/or epilogue of any method and gain access to arguments
(including the `this` reference), local variables, and the return
value.

This opens up countless possibilities for instrumenting framework
methods to learn how a program is utilizing facilities like the thread
pool, networking, reflection and so on.  It can also be useful for
debugging, especially if dealing with assemblies for which the source
code is not available.

Instrumenting Managed Allocators
--------------------------------

Another improvement we were able to make thanks to the redesigned API was to
use instrumented managed allocators when profiling. In the past, we would
disable managed allocators entirely when profiling. This would slow down
allocation-heavy programs significantly. Now, we insert a call back to the
profiler API at the end of managed allocators if profiling is enabled.

Simpler to Work With
--------------------

On top of these major features, the new API is also simply more pleasant to
use. In  particular, you no longer have to worry about setting event flags; you
simply install a callback and you will get events. Also, you no longer have to
use callback installation functions which take multiple callback arguments.
Every kind of callback now has exactly one function to install it. This means
you will no longer have code such as
`mono_profiler_install_assembly (NULL, NULL, load_asm, NULL);` where it can be
unclear which argument corresponds to which callback. Finally, several unused,
deprecated, or superseded features and callbacks have been removed.

Breaking Change
---------------

The new API completely replaces the old one, so this is a breaking change. We
try very hard to not break API/ABI compatibility in Mono's embedding API, but
after much consideration and evaluation of the alternatives, a breaking change
was deemed to be the most sensible way forward. To aid with the transition to
the new API, Mono will detect and refuse to load profiler modules that use
the old API. Developers who wish to support both the old and new APIs by
compiling separate versions of their profiler module may find the new
`MONO_PROFILER_API_VERSION` macro useful.
