We have just [released Mono 3.0.4](/docs/about-mono/releases/3.0.4/) to the world.

The release packs our SGen concurrent collector with a new strategy to deal with pinned objects called [cementing](http://schani.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/sgen-write-barrier/) (Mark discussed that last year). We are very excited about this new feature.

MacOS users will be happy to know that we no longer install a /usr/bin/pkg-config, so it will not break their homebrew installations and it only contains the new Gtk+ stack that allows the new [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/studio) to run on OSX with 3.0.
