Mimer SQL
=========

ADO.NET is an object-oriented interface for accessing and manipulating data in the Microsoft .NET Framework. It simplifies the development of multi-tier database applications both for web and traditional client/server environments.

The Mimer Data Provider 9.3 works equally well in Microsoft .NET 1.1 CLR and in the Mono runtime environment. With Mono you can access Mimer SQL from .NET applications on other platforms than Microsoft Windows.
