MonoTouch Troubleshoot
======================

#### this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key XXXX

If you get this error when loading a NIB file it means that the value XXXX was not found on your managed class. This means that you are missing a declaration like this:

``` csharp
[Connect]
TypeName XXXX {
   get {
       return (TypeName) GetNativeField ("XXXX");
   }
   set {
       SetNativeField ("XXXX", value);
   }
}
```

The above definition is automatically generated by MonoDevelop for any XIB files that you add to MonoDevelop in the `NAME_OF_YOUR_XIB_FILE.designer.xib.cs` file.

Additionally, the class that hosts this code must have the [Register] attribute.

#### You are getting a ModelNotImplementedException

If you are getting this exception this means that you are calling base.Method () on a class that overrides a Model. You do not need to call the base method in a class for models (these are classes that are flagged with the [Model] attribute).
