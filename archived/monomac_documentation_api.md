MonoMac/Documentation/API
=========================

API
===

MonoMac exposes a C#/CIL binding to the Cocoa API and also provides access to the ECMA CIL APIs and various other .NET& APIs.

**API Reference**: The API reference is available at [[1]](http://docs.go-mono.com); [MonoMac namespace documentation](http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=root:/monomac-lib)

**API Design**: The API design for the CIL/Objective-C binding is covered in the [API Design](/MonoMac/Documentation/API_Design "MonoMac/Documentation/API Design") document and it describes how we bound the Objective-C and C APIs from Cocoa and exposed those to the C#/CIL world.
