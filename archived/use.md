-   [The Monkeyguide tutorial](/Monkeyguide)
-   [How-To pages](/Howto)
-   [API Documentation](http://docs.go-mono.com/)
-   [Mailing Lists](/Mailing_Lists) to get help
-   [Bug reporting](/Bugs) to help us improve the software
-   Commercial [Support](/Support)

Core Components
===============

The Mono platform consists of the C# compiler, the just-in-time runtime, and other associated components:

-   [C# Compiler](/CSharp_Compiler)
-   [Mono Runtime](/Mono:Runtime)
-   [Debugger](/Debugger), [Debugger Tutorial](/Guide:Debugger) and [Debugging](/Debugging) techniques.

Mono supports several technologies for developing GUI desktop applications. Gtk# is a mature binding to the Gtk platform, which is used primarily for Gnome in Linux but also works in Windows with a native feel. System.Windows.Forms is in active development. CocoaSharp is used for developing Mac OSX applications.

-   [Gtk#](/GtkSharp)
-   [WinForms](/WinForms)
-   [CocoaSharp](/MonoMac)

Web applications are an integral part of the Mono platform as well. ASP.NET 1.0 applications can be run within the Apache web server using mod_mono or through a light-weight standalone C# web server called XSP. ASP.NET 2.0 support is in development. Infrastructure for web services and database access through a number of providers is also provided with Mono.

-   [Web Services](/Web_Services)
-   [Database Access](/Database_Access)

Mono comprises many other technologies as well, including cryptography, code access security, and internationalization.

-   [Cryptography Overview](/Cryptography)
-   [Security](/FAQ:_Security) (SSL/TLS, authenticode, PKI, CAS)
-   [Internationalization (I18N)](/Internationalization)
-   [Other Libraries](/Libraries)

Mono offers various ways of tuning your application:

-   [HeapShot](/HeapShot) live memory profiler.
-   [HeapBuddy](/HeapBuddy) total memory profiler.
-   [Code Coverage](/Code_Coverage) for evaluating your tests.
-   [Profile](/Profile) for more information on profiling.
