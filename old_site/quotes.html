<p>A few quotes from developers using Mono:

</p>
<pre>I had used C# before, which I really liked, but disliked the Microsoft-only  
aspects of it.  However, I had been watching the Mono project since it was 
announced.  There were few people in the Open Source world that held more 
credibility in my eyes than Miguel de Icaza. When I first looked at mono in 
2003, I was impressed with the quality of the product, even at that early 
stage. 

So, when we started imeem, we cross-compiled it on mono from day 1.  We didn't 
"port" to mono, mono was just part of our toolkit from the get-go.  It works 
really well.  Ximian/Novell has responded to bug-reports in a timely and 
helpful manner.  I have been able to meet a lot of the Mono team in real life, 
and they are genuinely funny, nice people.

So anyway, thanks to the Mono project.  I hope we can work together as imeem 
grows.

<pre>My company is using mono in a 3d game engine and wysiwyg game design tool.
We have embedded mono and use it as a scripting language. This allows our
users to pick from Javascript, C# and Boo.

Being able to use multiple languages is just wonderful and adds a lot of
value to our product. The speed of mono is absolutely stunning. (We are
coming from python). Switching from python to mono was an absolute success.

<pre>My company uses Mono to run our software on Linux/Solaris servers.  We provide
advanced analytics for pricing and risk management of credit derivatives.  The
analytics toolkit is composed of a mixture of C# and C++ (we chose .NET as our
platform in part because of its excellent support for interop with unmanaged
code).

In addition to the Toolkit, we also provide a Calculation Server (written in 
C#) and an Excel Addin (written in C# with a bit of Managed C++).  Of course 
the Excel Addin is MS specific.

Our support for Mono is relatively new and still considered beta, however 
we run our full regression test suite on Mono/Linux, so I think this can be 
considered a "real world" application.

</p>
<pre>My company (<a href="http://www.versora.com" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.versora.com</a>) uses Mono in a real world 
application. We do software that migrates system settings, application 
settings and data from Windows to Linux. We chose it because we had a 
large code base in C# .NET on Windows and a large portion of that code 
was reusable with minimal effort on Linux/Mono.

</p>
<pre>My reason is that Mono applications can be run without an install.  .NET 
requires a lengthy installation (and a reboot with 1.1 SP) that many 
administrators (if not users) will not consider.  Mono can be copied on (or 
even run from a memory stick).

<p>From a satisfied user on our <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2005-April/026486.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a>:
</p>
<pre>Ive recently successfully ported an ASP.Net application from MS .net to 
mono-1.1.4.

This application was approximately 250-300 days development, is 
currently deployed and in production on windows server 2003, has 2 
external interfaces and used an MS SQL server database. 

As an experiment I ported it to mono and mysql in approximately 20 
hours, and had it running under apache on an ubuntu linux box.
