|Disassembler/assembler
||
although today we have both tools, we are not very happy with our disassembler as it uses the Mono internal calls which are not really designed to cope with incomplete assemblies (we have an all-or-nothing codebase in this scenario).

|| jbevain is working on ildasm, still need to update the assembler.

|Code optimization using Cecil
||
this is a longer-term project, but today compilers that target the CIL are known to generate fairly straightforward CIL code leaving most of the work to the JIT engine.  An optimizer that could perform some tasks before the JIT compiler hits the code would be useful.
</p><p>Although our code generator is fairly good, and getting better the most effective optimizations are never turned on for JIT-use as they are very time consuming.
</p><p>There are a couple of temporary measures that can be taken to address this issue (ahead-of-time compilation and dynamic recompilation).  Both have small drawbacks.
</p><p>A code optimizer would convert a CIL stream into a different CIL stream that is compatible but has applied some
optimizations before the JIT sees them.
</p><p>These optimizations could be a lot more complex than what the JIT compiler can do today doing things like loop unrolling or
processing a file to automatically multithread some pieces of
the program.  
</p><p>It is rumored that the MS C++ compiler produces better code than the C# compiler as it does do some IL-level loop unrolling for example.

|| Must validate claims, could reuse the semantic information from a bug-finding tool.
