[ObjC\#]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/ObjCSharp "ObjCSharp")
------------------------------------------------------------

ObjC\# is a transparent two way bridge that allows the CLR to access the rich underlying ObjectiveC frameworks as well as providing direct access to the CLR frameworks from the ObjectiveC language.

[IKVM]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/IKVM "IKVM")
------------------------------------------------

[IKVM]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/IKVM "IKVM") is a framework required to host and interface with Java byte code on top of the MS .NET and Mono runtimes.

[GAPI]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/GAPI "GAPI")
------------------------------------------------

[GAPI]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/GAPI "GAPI") is a xml based code generator included in GTK\#, to build bindings (ussally) completely 100% cli based bridges to many different GObject and GLib classes.

[SWIG](http://www.swig.org)
---------------------------

Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is a code generator that builds bindings for many languages including C\# to communicate with C and C++. (It should be noted that most nearly all C interfaces can be handled by the built-in p/invoke interfaces without the need to use SWIG to do this)
