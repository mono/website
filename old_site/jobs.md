Jobs
====

The Mono development team is incredibly distributed (with folks living in different parts of the world on a spread of timezones), so you must be comfortable developing in a distributed manner. This means that you should be able to communicate with the rest of the team over email and irc and must have some flexibility with your time when it comes to coordinating with developers on other time zones.

We are also a small team with many tasks in mind, so you will usually have to step in to assist others in the team, with release engineering when we need your help.
