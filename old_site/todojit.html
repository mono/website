<h1>TODO:JIT</h1>

<p>|-
|Delegate Optimization||There a number of new optimizations for special cases of delegates, these are quite visible in IronPython 2.0 and DLR-based applications (there is a significant performance drop for Mono while it should have been a performance increase)||Medium||align="center"|1-2 months||See <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=81663" class="external text" rel="nofollow">this bug</a> for details on what we know.
|-
|Generics Code Cleanup||Need details from Paolo on the work needed||Medium||align="center"|1 month||N/A
|-
|Performance Reasearch||Mono is known to be not as performance as the .NET Framework, but not enough information is available about where the actual weak spots are.   Tests like SciMark and IronPython pybench could be used to understand our current limitations||Medium-hard||align="center"|1-3 months||N/A
|-
|JIT (mono/mini/)||Port the JIT to additional architectures. Currently ports exist for x86, x86-64, ppc, sparc, mips and s390.<br />Ports to more architectures are welcome as well.||Medium-hard||align="center"|1-3 months per arch||N/A
|-
|JIT (mono/mini/)||Optimize AOT compiler output. Currently the code generated by the AOT compiler may be significantly slower than jitted code. This is mostly because the AOT code supports multiple application domains and some values that are constant at JIT-time are not constant at AOT-time. It may be needed to write a simple dynamic linker and/or binary object writer. A possible idea for improvements is also the use of appdomain ID-indexed tables to get at the appdomain specific data.||Medium-hard (thesis subject)||align="center"|3-6 months||Zoltan Varga is working on this.
