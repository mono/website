Mono Documentation Improvement Project
======================================

 Although most of the concepts from the Microsoft.NET Framework can be applied to Mono, we do need to have a complete set of free documentation written specifically for Mono.

The [http://www.mono-project.com/]({{ site.github.url }}/) wiki is designed to be a centralized repository for all mono-related documentation and information, to make it easy for users to find what they need.

The wiki is currently a pretty good mess, and we desperately need your help with cleaning up existing pages, as well as writing new ones.

Writing New Pages
=================

-   Think about something that you recently had a lot of trouble finding information about and create a page dedicated to it!

-   If you need an idea for something to write, check out [Special:Wantedpages]({{ site.github.url }}/old_site/Special:WantedPages "Special:WantedPages").

Cleanup
=======

Here are some suggestions of ways to help clean the wiki up:

-   **Go through the [documentation table of contents]({{ site.github.url }}/old_site/Start "Start") and find new things to add to it.
    **
-   Go through [Special:Shortpages]({{ site.github.url }}/old_site/Special:ShortPages "Special:ShortPages") and add more content.
-   Go through [Special:Lonelypages]({{ site.github.url }}/old_site/Special:LonelyPages "Special:LonelyPages"), figure out which page(s) should link back to this page, and add the link.
-   Go through the [Uncategorizedpages]({{ site.github.url }}/Special:Uncategorizedpages) list and categorize the pages.
-   Go through the [Longpages]({{ site.github.url }}/Special:Longpages) list and if it makes sense, split them up into seporate pages.
-   If you see a page that looks like a big mess, add "****

    ``` nowiki
    {{NeedsCleanup}}
    ```

    " to the top.
    You can see every page that is marked as needing cleanup at [NeedsCleanup]({{ site.github.url }}/Category:NeedsCleanup).

-   If you see a page that looks incomplete, add "****

    ``` nowiki
    {{Incomplete}}
    ```

    " to the top.
    You can see every page that is marked as incomplete at [Incomplete]({{ site.github.url }}/Category:Incomplete).

-   If you see a page that looks out of date, add "****

    ``` nowiki
    {{Obsolete}}
    ```

    " to the top.
    You can see every page that is marked as obsolete at [Obsolete]({{ site.github.url }}/Category:Obsolete).

-   Go through the mailing list archives, and pay attention on IRC. If someone asked a question that was answered, but is not properly documented, create a new wiki page or add it to the [FAQ]({{ site.github.url }}/old_site/FAQ "FAQ").

In-Progress Tasks & Discussion
==============================

-   See the [Talk:Mono\_Documentation\_Improvement\_Project]({{ site.github.url }}/old_site/Talk:Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project "Talk:Mono Documentation Improvement Project") page for an overview about what all is currently being discussed.
-   All articles that are currently under construction can be found in the [Sandbox-Category]({{ site.github.url }}/Category:Sandbox)

Writing good Documentation
==========================

[TechScribe](http://www.techscribe.co.uk/techw/articles.htm) is full of short articles about good documentation, please take a look at them.

Prizes
======

Novell will hopefully be able to offer mono schwag (stickers, t-shirts, etc.) as prizes to those who work on documentation, more information to come soon.
