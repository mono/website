MaintainingTheWiki
==================

Maintaining the Mono Wiki discusses the etiquette used on the Mono Project's Wiki site.

In general, people are welcomed to add new content, add new questions and improve the content, but it is always good to keep these rules in mind:

-   When in doubt, contact miguel@novell.com.

-   If you are going to do a large reorganization, do not break the existing content and reorganize and leave it unfinished. Its best to work on separate pages while you reorganize and when its done, we can switch over to it.

-   Advocacy comments. It is best to not use the Mono Wiki for advocacy and it is never a good idea to make inflamatory comments about other projects, companies or products.

-   Avoid doing comparisons on the Wiki with other products unless you have been given approval by the Mono project.

-   FAQ editing: try to use an impersonal tone, and not a personal tone for the FAQ as multiple people edit and contribute to the document.
