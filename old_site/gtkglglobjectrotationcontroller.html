<h1>GtkGL.GLObjectRotationController</h1>

<p>This class may be a bit too specific for other code to make use of, but it was a good way to clean up the idea of the object rotation controller window for me.  This class represents the window with +/- buttons for X, Y and Z rotations.  It keeps all of the state information about the object's rotation and displays it in the entry fields
