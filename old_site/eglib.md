Eglib
=====

eglib is an embedded glib library available in the [mono repo](http://github.com/mono/mono/tree/master/eglib), which is a drop in replacement for glib for systems which don't have glib (or for users that prefer a reduced/slimmed version).

eglib is not present in tarballs before version 2.7.

For more information, read the [README](http://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/eglib/README).
