Follow the instructions on the [download page](/download/stable/#download-lin) for the latest stable release. Alternatively, you can also try the [preview](/download/preview/#download-lin) version.

Accessing older releases
------------------------

If for some reason you want to pin an older version of Mono rather than updating to the latest, you can modify the Debian repository to "wheezy/snapshots/X.XX.X" instead of "wheezy". For example, "wheezy/snapshots/3.10.0" will lock you to that version.

These snapshots will cease receiving updates as soon as the next major Mono version gets uploaded - for example, as soon as Mono 3.12 gets uploaded, 3.10 will never receive updates.

On RPM distributions, force the package version in your package manager - all older versions are published in the YUM metadata and should be available.
