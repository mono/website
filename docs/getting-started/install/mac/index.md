Mono runs on Mac, this page describes the various features available for users who want to use Mono or Mono-based technologies on macOS.

Installing Mono on macOS is very simple:

1.  [Download](/download/stable/#download-mac) the latest Mono release for Mac
2.  Run the .pkg file and accept the terms of the license. Mono is now installing:
