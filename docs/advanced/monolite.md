Monolite is a minimal binary distribution of mcs.

You can get the latest build from our public Jenkins server:

[https://jenkins.mono-project.com/](https://jenkins.mono-project.com/)

You can find a full tarball release as well as a monolite distribution for every commit from the [build-source-tarball-mono](https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Packaging-Mono/job/build-source-tarball-mono/) job. The topmost green link points to the most recent successful build, and you can find the latest release and monolite tarballs from there:  Click on the build, and select "S3 Artifacts".

Installers and packages for Windows, Mac and Linux are also available from Jenkins.
