Monolite is a minimal binary distribution of mcs.

You can get the latest build from our public Wrench server:

[https://wrench.mono-project.com/Wrench/](https://wrench.mono-project.com/Wrench/)

You can find a full tarball release as well as a monolite distribution for every commit from the [mono-dist-master](https://wrench.mono-project.com/Wrench/index.aspx?lane=mono-dist-master) lane. The topmost green link points to the most recent successful build, and you can find the latest release and monolite tarballs from there.

Installers and packages for Windows, Mac and Linux are also available from Wrench.
