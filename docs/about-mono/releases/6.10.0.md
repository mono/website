## Runtime

### WebAssembly

We continue to work on making our WebAssembly support better. Various sets of issues have been resolved in this release and general performance and feature work is happening as well.

### Community improvements for AIX/PASE and Haiku

The ports for these systems received a bunch of improvements from community contributor Calvin Buckley ([@NattyNarwhal](https://github.com/NattyNarwhal)).

## Class Libraries

### CoreFX integration

We continued to replace some of our classes with the implementation from CoreFX to improve performance and compatibility with .NET.
