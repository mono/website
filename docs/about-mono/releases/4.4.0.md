Highlights

In Depth
========

## Class Libraries

Our build system has been reconfigured to become a 4.x setup, as
opposed to 4.5 only and it's now tracking .NET 4.6.1 APIs.

Targeting earlier .NET profiles happens via so-called reference assemblies,
which we introduced in [Mono 4.0](/docs/about-mono/releases/4.0.0/#dropped-support-for-old-frameworks).

To make it more clear that these are just used for compilation and not
during runtime (they contain only metadata, no actual method IL),
we renamed the profile folders in `<prefix>/lib/mono/`.

The folder structure on disk when installing Mono now looks like this:

```
<prefix>/lib/mono/
  ├── 2.0-api
  ├── 3.5-api
  ├── 4.0-api
  ├── 4.5-api
  ├── 4.5
  ...
```

*Note:* The `4.5` folder contains the actual assemblies that are used
during runtime. We're considering these the `latest` assemblies from
now on, i.e. right now they're implementing .NET 4.6.1.
Unfortunately, we couldn't rename this folder as too many apps and
libraries hardcoded checks for this path.

### TLS

We have added a new implementation of TLS that supports TLS up to
version 1.2 (the old version only supported up to 1.0).  This is a
completely new implementation, and given that it is new, we do not
currently default to it, but we hope to switch to it in the future.

We have an implementation switcher on both the `SslStream` and
`HttpListener` classes.  The default implementation of `SslStream` for now
continues to be the old Mono TLS implementation, the one that supports
SSL and up to TLS 1.0.  But it is now possible to switch the
implementation to either our new managed implementation or any
implementation built on top of something else.

You can control this with the `MONO_TLS_PROVIDER` environment variable.
The possible settings are as follows:

* `default` - let Mono choose the best implementation available for the
platform, currently this is hardcoded to the old implementation, but
we will change this once we complete the audit of our TLS stack, and
we might change this on a per-platform basis to use SslStream
implementations that use some native library.

* `oldtls` - Mono’s historical implementation, it only goes up to TLS 1.0.

* `newtls` - Mono’s new managed implementation, it supports TLS 1.0 up to
1.2

* Any full typename - You can specify a fully qualified .NET Type, this
can be used to test alternative implementations without changing
Mono’s runtime: `MONO_TLS_PROVIDER="Mono.Security.Providers.NewTls.NewTlsProvider,
Mono.Security.Providers.NewTls, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=84e3aee7225169c2`

For custom implementations, the type should subclass the
`Mono.Security.Interface.MonoTlsProvider` interface from the
`Mono.Security` assembly and have a public parameterless constructor.

### WCF

`WebHttpBinding` must use http scheme in case when `SecurityMode` ==
`WebHttpSecurityMode.TransportCredentialOnly`

## Runtime

### Embedding API

The embedding API now has the following additions:

* `mini_parse_debug_option` allows embedders to set debug options
  programatically, without going through the `MONO_DEBUG` environment variable.

### Bitcode

It is now possible to configure the runtime to generate LLVM bitcode
when passing the `--with-bitcode` option to `configure`. This mode of
operation avoids certain low-level optimizations that require assembly
code to be used and instead limits the runtime to use constructs that
can be expressed entirely in bitcode mode.  This is designed to
support scenarios where you want to use LLVM to drive the entire
compilation process.

### Unmanaged Thin Locks

This avoids allocation of new MonoThreadsSync structures for the
typical cases of shallow nesting of uncontended locks. The necessary
information (owner, nest and status bits) is embedded in the
synchronisation field of a MonoObject. The lock is inflated when the
nest overflows or when there is contention on the lock.

This greatly improves performance (over 10 times) for the case of
locking a lock only a few times, due to the inflation avoidance. It
also improves performance up to 25% for the case of locking a thin
lock. A decrease in performance (up to 3 times slower) can happen for
the case of repetitive nesting of a lock, due to the need of a CAS at
each entry/exit.

### libmono now defaults to SGen

The `libmono` library now defaults to using Mono with SGen,
previously, it defaulted to Boehm.

### FullAOT: Generic Value Type Sharing improvements

More code is now shared with Value Type sharing and we no longer
generate shared wrappers for method signatures as those are not
needed.

## Garbage Collector

This release contains a new mode of operation for Mono's SGen garbage
collector as well as many performance optimizations,and memory usage
and throughput optimizations

### Cooperative Mode

Mono has historically used garbage collectors that can run at any
time, that is, when a garbage collection is triggered, the GC system
stops all threads preemptively and performs a garbage collection.

This is a behavior that we inherited from Boehm's GC which was great
in the early days of Mono, as it allowed us to get a working garbage
collector in no time, but also made the garbage collector harder to
debug.

We have introduced a new cooperative configuration to our garbage
collector that makes it easier to debug garbage collector related
problems and reduces the operating system specific requirements to
have a functioning garbage collector.

This mode can be enabled by setting the `MONO_ENABLE_COOP` environment
variable.

## Implement Thread Priority Setting

Implement a `SetPriority`/`GetPriority` facility for real-time threads: if
mono is executed using the `SCHED_RR` policy, we will map POSIX priorities
to .NET priorities. Under this policy a thread running under this policy
which uses the `SetPriority` API will have its priority remapped and a
call to `pthread_setschedparam()` made to change its priority.

For a sample program that shows how to run a Mono application without
requiring all root privileges other than the CAP_SYS_NICE
capability which enables priority manipulation see the [thread-priority page](https://http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/runtime/thread-priority)

## LLVM Only Mode

It is now possible to use the Mono runtime in LLVM-only mode.  This
mode avoids the use of any assembly optimized code, or the mixed mode
of Mono+LLVM.   This is used to generate standard LLVM bitcode.

This comes at the expense of some performance optimizations that are
not possible to express with stock LLVM.

### Concurrent GC

We continue to improve the concurrent capabilities of the garbage
collector, among those we enabled
[cementing](https://schani.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/sgen-write-barrier/)
for it, and tuned various parameters of nursery collection and
improved the diagnostic capabilities of the concurrent GC.

### GC Handles

We have made the implementation of GC handles lock-free. The previous
implementation would take a lock every time a GC handle was accessed
(e.g., with `WeakReference.Target` or `WeakReference.IsAlive`).
Removing this locking improves the performance of these operations by
orders of magnitude—particularly on OS X, where locking is costly.

## Profiler

We are now annotating our GC roots, so the profiler can get better
visibility into the nature of objects that keep objects alive.

## Threadpool

We no longer use the sparse array for the threadpool, as for many
thread it would slow down some operations.

## Debugger

The soft debugger now allows nested invocations to take place.

## PowerPC

The PowerPC backend has been updated to support big endian systems.

## Process API

Refactored the Process API (FIXME: Marek, what was the source of this?)

C# Compiler

Tools
=====

### csharp

The interactive C# shell now implements code completion by showing a
popup on the screen instead of using the Bash-style results.

Code completion is also triggered by the "." character, which is
convenient in many cases, in addition to the existing TAB.

### mdoc

Improved the rendering of Platform enumerations for platforms like iOS
where we are interested in when an API was first introduced, not all
the platforms that also support it.

Improved the handling of generic methods.

#### mdoc - New options

New `-api-style` parameter and `-multiassembly` parameters can be used
to update documentation in scenarios where we want to maintain a
single XML API, but target slightly different source assemblies (like
we have to do for Xamarin.iOS's classic and unified, or iOS, tvOS and
WatchOS).

The new `multiassembly` option lets you run `mdoc update` on
assemblies that contain the same types. This can come into play when
you have a set of assemblies that run on different platforms, with a
slightly differing API surface area on each platform (for example:
tvOS, watchOS, iOS); in th`is case you can maintain all of the
documentation in a single set of XML documents.

With this option enabled, an `AssemblyInfo` node will be added for
every assembly that a type is found in, in addition to every
member. While this may seem verbose, it's really the only way to
capture the information about what assemblies a given type or member
can be found in.

### mkbundle

Now supports the `--quiet` flag to prevent diagnostics messages from being printed out.

### xbuild

Roslyn support: It now copies the Portable PDB files generated by the
Roslyn compiler to the output directory.

### babysitter

This new script replaces GNU timeout and is intended to be used by
automated builds of Mono on Jenkins or other continuous build systems.
In addition, it:

* Logs machine readable output about each test suite (as
  line-delimited json)
* If the test suite uses NUnit, can detect if a test case failed or
  crashed (terminated mono in mid-test), and retry unsuccessful tests
  (up to a limit).
