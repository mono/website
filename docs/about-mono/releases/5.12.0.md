# In Depth

## Runtime

### Interpreter

A lot of work has been put in stabilising and passing our test suite. Progress has been quite fast and we now pass most of the runtime, mcs, mscorlib and Mono.Debugger.Soft test suites. We are also reaching the point where the Interpreter is able to build the full Base Class Library with Mono C# compiler (mcs).

### IBM AIX and IBM i

[@NattyNarwhal](https://github.com/NattyNarwhal) has made the great effort of porting Mono on [IBM AIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX) and [i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i)! While a lot features work, such as BoringTLS, other things do not, such as the ahead-of-time compiler or Roslyn. For any question about this port, please join the discussion on our [Gitter channel](http://gitter.im/mono/mono/).

### Haiku

[@NattyNarwhal](https://github.com/NattyNarwhal) has also made the [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/) port support amd64; unfortunately neither i386 and amd64 work just yet due to various runtime termination issues.

### WebAssembly

The WebAssembly port features better support through the Mono SDKs effort and several issues were fixed around GC and Base Class Libraries.

### Jemalloc

We now have an option to support [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) as the malloc(3) library, its speed allows for faster desktop applications. You'll need to compile Mono with `--with-jemalloc` to enable it and then set `MONO_USE_JEMALLOC` environment variable at runtime. Jemalloc is known to have much better performance than system memory allocators and is safe in concurrent/re-entrant situations.

### Profiler: improved GC roots reporting

A rework of the mechanism to report GC roots allows both the Xamarin.Profiler as well as mprof-report to better track their lifetimes.

### PAL

Added support for nanosecond resolution in file information on platforms where the information is available.
This means the return value of APIs like `FileInfo.GetLastWriteTime ()` is now more precise.

### Diagnostic enhancements

The diagnostic support to inspect generated native code via `MONO_VERBOSE_METHOD` environement variable was extended to support multiple entries.

## Class Libraries

`HttpWebRequest` async handling has been rewritten. This resolves many long-standing and hard to reproduce issues involving requests cancellation or
timeout. As `HttpWebRequest` is used as the underlying implementation by other types like `HttpClient` this should improve the reliability of a broad range of types.

A few internal types were decorated with `StackTraceHiddenAttribute` to produce more readable managed stack-traces. The improvement will be
most noticeable in scenarios involving `ExceptionDispatchInfo` (e.g. async stack-traces).

The `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` namespace in the System.Security assembly has been replaced with the CoreFX implementation. This makes Mono XML Signature (also called XMLDSig) support highly compatible with .NET.

The ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib assembly was marked as obsolete and will be removed in a future release. We recommend replacing the very old implementation
we ship with the official NuGet package available at [https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpZipLib/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpZipLib/).

## Tools

### illinkanalyzer

A new tool called the Linker Analyzer was introduced, available via the `illinkanalyzer` command. It helps in advanced scenarios to analyze dependencies which were recorded during linker processing and caused the linker to mark an item to keep it in the resulting linked assembly.

### VB.NET compiler

We now ship the Roslyn based VB.NET compiler. This is a fully featured VB.NET compiler integrated in msbuild but is also available via the `vbc` command which supports significantly more features than the old `vbnc` compiler. We are going to deprecate the old `vbnc` compiler and we encourage everyone to test the new tool.
