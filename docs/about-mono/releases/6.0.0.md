Highlights
==========

This is the first release of new 6.x series with many improvements and bug fixes across the whole Mono Runtime. In addition to that here are additional highlights.

* C# compiler defaults to version C# 8.0 RC
* Various stability improvement in debugger support
* Mono Interpreter is feature complete and stable

# In Depth

## Runtime

### CLI Improvements

New runtime setting called `llcopts` add an option to control arguments to `llc` tool. Use this option to add more flags to the built-in set of flags passed to the LLVM system compiler. If not provided, it will fallback to `-mcpu=generic` on x86 systems.

Additional new commands called `llvmopts-add` and `llvmllc-add` have been added to allow simply append additional arguments to LLVM's `opt` and `llc` tools.

    mono --aot=llvm,llvmopts-add="-foo",llvmllc-add="-foo"

We have also improved response file handling to work better on Windows.

### Interpreter

A lot of attention in this release went to stabilizing and testing interpreter support. We have resolved many outstanding issues in handling different IL constructs as well as reported issues on ARM architecture.

This release also includes the first set of performance optimizations targeting interpreter mode only.

### AOT Size Optimizations

The methods table format for AOT has changed to support large assemblies (larger than 24bits offsets) on ARM producing now larger binary output but with no limitations on input IL size.

Encoding ad decoding of various context data structures have been optimized to minimize duplication of their data entries.

### System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe

Support for more methods available in the newer versions of this special NuGet assembly has been added as special runtime intrinsics for increased performance.

### Debugger

Various set of issues and problems with debugger has been resolved or mitigated in this release. They should increase the stability of the debugger when debugging complex issues or multi-threaded applications.

Additional features like time recording between debugger steps have been added to the underlying debugger protocol.

### System.Math methods optimizations

The constant folding for some Math operations on doubles has been implemented. In particular support for constant folding of additions and multiplications of doubles as well as constant folding of Math.Sin, Math.Cos, Math.Abs and Math.Sqrt.

### Initial RISC-V support

We have landed experimental support in the interpreter for RISC-V. It's able to run Hello World like C# program with all necessary runtime support.

### monograph

This obsolete utility has been removed.

## Class Libraries

Class Libraries have been extended with implementation support for C# 8.0 language features like async-streams. The CoreFX based parts have been updated to track .NET Core 2.2 release.

### mscorlib

Implementation of TimeZone related classes and most of `System.Reflection` and `System.IO` classes have been replaced with CoreFX implementation for better compatibility with .NET and with performance improvements.

The Japanese calendar now includes support for the new eras.

### Mono.Cairo

Several code paths have been hardened to throw ObjectDisposedExceptions instead of native crashes.

### System.Winforms.Forms

More fixes and layout improvements for different controls made by external contributors have landed in this release .

## Tools

### Removed bundled version of NUnit 2.4

Mono used to ship with a forked copy of NUnit 2.4 that we used for testing Mono itself. For historical reasons, it was never updated and it is ancient at this point (it was released nearly 12 years ago!).

We deprecated it in [Mono 5.0](/docs/about-mono/releases/5.0.0/#nunit) and are removing it now.

We recommend that you migrate to a recent version of NUnit from NuGet or the project's website instead.

### C# Compiler

Roslyn C# compiler has been upgraded to version 3.1.

### F# Compiler

Bundled F# compiler is now tracking [version 4.5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-f-4-5/).

### NuGet

Bundled NuGet version has been upgraded to [5.1 RTM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-5.1-rtm).

### msbuild

msbuild tool and its supporting libraries have been upgraded to version 15.0

### signcode

The signcode tool got support for a new hash algorithm. In particular SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 hash algorithms to be used for Authenticode signatures.

## Packaging

The compression format used for `make dist` has been changed from BZip2 to XZ.

We have also included embedded Source Link information to all managed debug symbols files (PDBs) for the better debugging experience.

## Build improvements

The support for LLVM integrated build as part of the Visual Studio solution has been added.
