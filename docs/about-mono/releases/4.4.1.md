-   [#41782](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41782) - \[Cycle 7\] "System.Net.WebException: Error: NameResolutionFailure" when attempting web requests with certain raw IP addresses

## Changes in the OSX installation package

The Mono package now uses a file in `/etc/paths.d` for adding the Mono commands to the PATH on OSX, instead of adding symlinks to `/usr/local/bin` which is in the PATH by default. A side effect of this is that the Mono commands won't be available in your terminal session right away until you restart it.

If you install Mono in a script or some other automated manner you can run `eval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)` to reload the PATH changes and make the commands available. We're looking at integrating this into the installer in a future release.
