title: Mono 1.0.5 Release Notes
---

For detailed information about Mono, please see the [Mono 1.0](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0/) release notes.

Mono 1.0.5 is a maintenance release release for the 1.0 series of the Mono runtime. The Mono 1.0.xx series is the edition of stable releases of the Mono runtime.

New In Mono 1.0.5
-----------------

There are many bug fixes, optimizations and scalability fixes that have been backported from the Mono 1.1.xx releases, but in addition:

### MonoDoc

MonoDoc now includes the new MonkeyGuide from Shane, cleaned up and simplified.

Joshua updated the `monodocer` tool, and by extension the documentation has been updated and improved for various classes.

Plenty of updated API documentation for Gtk# developers.

The only bad news is that currently the Gtk# tutorial is not shipped as it needs to be reviewed for correctness against Gtk# 1.0 (it was wrong in a few places).

### XSP server

The XSP server performance has been increased by supporting keep-alive connections. Despite being only a testing server, it was being used by a few sites.

### Monodoc

Atsushi ported monodoc's ASP.NET interface so it works on Windows now.

Monodoc now can convert the output of the C# compiler -doc switch into ECMA XML documentation, so you can browse it with monodoc (command line option --cs-to-ecma).

### Security

Endian fixes for Authenticode and NTLM (OSX, SPARC).

Fixed RC4 to work under MS FX 2.0 runtime (empty IV);

Fixed padding for keys that aren't a multiple of 8 bits (e.g. a 1023 bits public key);

Added support for SSLv2 ClientHello message to allow FireFox, IE and wget to work with SslServerStream (Carlos, Sebastien);

Added key blinding (on by default) to RSAManaged to avoid possible timing attacks (Sebastien).

### ADO.NET

Dan improved Sqlsharp tool to load data providers from the Mono GAC, this is using the Mono.Data demultiplexor (ProviderFactory).
