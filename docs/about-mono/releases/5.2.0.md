Strong assembly names
---------------------

Mono will now optionally respect public keys and version numbers when loading strongly signed assemblies.  If Mono is invoked with the `--assembly-loader=strict` option, then requests (whether via a static assembly reference, or using an assembly name using the reflection API) that include a public key token and version number will only load strong named assemblies with a matching token and name (respecting any bindings in relevant app config files).  

To debug the assembly loading process, set the logging environment variables to trace level "info" or lower and trace filter to include "asm".  (See [Logging runtime events](/docs/advanced/runtime/logging-runtime-events/).)

The current default behavior is the same as in previous Mono versions. It is explicitly available with the `--assembly-loader=legacy` option.
