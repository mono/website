Hello everyone!

We have just released Mono 0.21, only a few days after 0.20 due
mainly to a bug in the compiler which made it abort on top-level enums
and delegates on Windows.

In the meantime, various other minor bugs were fixes on the class
libraries, the runtime and the compiler.  Mono is available at the
usual location:

    http://www.mono-project.com/download/

We released packages for SuSE 8.0, Mandrake 8.2, and various Red
Hat releases.  Alp has contributed Debian packages as well.  It is
also available from Red Carpet on the Mono channel.

Source code for Mono, MCS, and XSP is available as well from that
web page.  The sources are:

MCS package (Class Libraries, C# and VB.NET compiler and managed tools):

    http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.21.tar.gz

Mono package (Runtime engine, JIT compiler):

XSP package (XSP test web server for ASP.NET webforms):

    http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.3.tar.gz

The contributors since version 0.20 were: Alan Tam, Atsushi
Enomoto, Daniel Lopez, Dave Bettin, Dick Porter, Dietmar Maurer,
Duncan Mak, Gonzalo Paniagua, Kevin Breit, Lluis Sanchez, Martin
Baulig, Miguel de Icaza, Mike Kestner, Nick Drochak, Paolo Molaro, Per
