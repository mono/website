Release History
===============

* 5.8.0.103 - Preview Release _(10 January 2018)_

Highlights
==========

Initial WebAssembly port landed. This release includes our preliminary port of mono to WebAssembly. It should be possible to build both the runtime and class libraries targeting it.


In Depth
========

Runtime
-------

Runtime verifier now supports C# 7.0 byref returns.

Improved compatibily with alternative languages that depend on implicit widening of locals.

Profiler
--------

New quiet mode to the profiler where a minimal set of events are enabled by default and all high volume events must be explicitly enabled. This gives better control on the profiler and should make it usable for long profiling sessions.


Class Libraries
