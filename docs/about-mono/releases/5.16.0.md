# In Depth

## Runtime

### LLVM

A new option `llvmopts` has been added to allow override the built-in set of flags passed to the LLVM optimizer.

### Response files support

A response file is a plain-text file that contains strings to be treated as arguments for mono runtime. You can now use a new option `--response=FILE` to pass the file with arguments in and they will be treated as if the user had instead entered the arguments individually.

### Assembly loader

The loading of mixed strong named and non-strong names assemblies has been improved to further match .NET desktop behaviour. At the same time, we have introduces a new separation of loader contexts which can influence the loader behaviour. The context could be seen when using Mono debug options and we recognize 4 distinguish contexts.

* default - Assembly.Load API
* reflection only - Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoad and Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoadFrom APIs
* load from - Assembly.LoadFrom API
* individual - Assembly.LoadFile API

### Hybrid suspend

Hybrid suspend is a new mechanism that Mono's garbage collector may use to pause threads when during garbage collection.
Threads that are running managed code or code that is part of the managed runtime periodically reach *safepoints* that indicate to the GC that it is allowed to suspend the thread.  When threads are running P/Invokes or other native code outside of Mono's control, the threads are suspended preemptively.  Hybrid suspend brings some of the benefits of cooperative GC without requiring changes to embedder native code.

In 5.16, hybrid suspend is turned on by default on Linux (amd64 and i386) and macOS.  There are `configure` flags and environment variables available to control the suspend mechanism:

- Pass `--enable-hybrid-suspend` to `configure` to turn on hybrid suspend by default.  Pass `--disable-hybrid-suspend --disable-cooperative-suspend` to use the old preemptive suspend as the default mechanism.
- At runtime set the environment variable `MONO_THREADS_SUSPEND` to `preemptive` to use preemptive suspend or `hybrid` to use hybrid suspend.

### 32-bit floating operations

Performing 32-bit floating operations using 32-bit math is now the default settings for the runtime. Previously you had to manually enable the setting by using `-O=float32` option.

### Copy file on macOS

We have rewritten file copy operations on macOS to use special native API for file copying. This can significantly speed up large files operations on Apple File System (APFS) and has positive impact on non-APFS file systems as well.

### The debugger library

The runtime can be configured using `--enable-minimal=soft_debug` option and the debugger code will be compiled into a separate `libmono-dbg.a` library. The library needs to be linked into the app if needed.

### Custom modifiers enhancements

The custom modifiers are not broadly used feature of IL but getting more exposure in the latest C# compilers. We have fixed a few issues in handling them especially around type equality with custom modifiers.

## Class Libraries

### Optimizations

The underlying implementation of `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` APIs was converted from portable IL implementation to intrinsics optimized version to fine-tune the implementation.
  
Additionally, special de-virtualization paths were introduced to speed up the execution of some `EqualityComparer<T>.Equals` and `Enum.HasFlags` calls.

### CoreFX convergence

The effort to replace more BCL code advanced further by fully replacing System.Xml.Linq, System.Json, System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow, System.ServiceModel.Syndication assemblies as well as some of the large namespaces in core assemblies including System.Net.Mail, System.ComponentModel, System.Text.Encoding.

### Client certificate support

We now support client certificates for authentication as well as making requests to web servers that use TLS renegotiation.

The TLS renegotiation on macOS requires version 10.12 or newer.

### System.MathF type

The single-precision math operations are now available in a new `System.MathF` class. Together with the `-O=float32` option, this can be used to noticeably improve the performance in floating point intensive source code.

### Prettier exception stack-traces

Ben Adams has contributed prettier exception printer, especially for generated code stack traces. For example, the async exceptions are now automatically de-mangled and instead of showing
```
System.ApplicationException: Error in the application.
  at X+<Foo>d__1.MoveNext () [0x0006c] in /path/foo.cs:14 <---
```

the stack trace shows the C# code signature

```
System.ApplicationException: Error in the application.
  at X.Foo () [0x0006c] in /path/foo.cs:14 <---
```

### Mono.Options

The arbitrary command nesting is now supported. The two new mechanisms were introduced to allow that. The command names may now contain spaces and `CommandSets` may be nested within `CommandSets`. This allows supporting syntax like:

```
$ azure config mode arm
$ azure vm create
```

### Automatic proxy configuration

The automatic proxy configuration has been updated to work correctly with newer macOS versions such as 10.13.

## Tools

### C# compiler

The Roslyn compiler (csc) has been updated to version 2.8.2 which includes C# 7.3 support. The full list of language features is documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7-3).

The Mono C# compiler (mcs) supported features were extended to support additional C# 7.x features:

* conditional ref expression
* stackalloc span conversion in conditional expression
* digits separators

### MSBuild

MSBuild support has been updated to match the Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 version.

### sn

The sn tool, the utility for signing assemblies, has been updated to support signing PE32+ assemblies.

### mkbundle

mkbundle has been extended to allow further customization of Mono runtime initialization sequence. It can be now controlled by setting BundleMonoAPI which contains the pointers to various Mono API functions used by the generated code. This mechanism is intended to be used by third parties which embed the Mono runtime and dynamically load and initialize it as part of the application startup, in which case the Mono APIs is not available for the shared library loader.

The `--mono-api-struct-path` parameter can be used to specify a file that is injected into the generated code, replacing the default structure definition.
