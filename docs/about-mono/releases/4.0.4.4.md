4.0.4.4 is an OSX hotfix release for mono 4.0.4.

Bug Fix
---------

* [33585](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=33585): El Capitan System Integrity Protection support.

El Capitan SIP removes DYLD_ environment variables when launching programs from the shell. This adversely affects our users.
The fix is to extend the search path for dynamic libraries to include the prefix where mono is installed. Which is not
usually on the dynamic linker path.
