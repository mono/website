MacOS Updates
=============

This release bundles the new version of Gtk+ 2 that has been fine tuned for MacOS X and fixes hundreds of problems that have been reported by users of MonoDevelop on Mac. In addition, it adds support for Lion's Smooth Scrolling.

Changes
=======

-   Fix a libgdiplus issue that had forced linking against Apple's X11 stack for text rendering.
-   Fix issue where a native crash causes MonoDevelop to hang and neither Force Quit nor kill -9 would terminate it (Xamarin #2548).
-   Fix sgen failing with Assertion at sgen-gc.c:2506, condition \`mono_sgen_need_bridge_processing ()' not met.
