title: Release Notes Mono 3.6
---

Mono 3.6.0 has 878 commits since the last release. This is the work of 66 contributors since March 10 2014. Out of those, 22 have done their first contribution. 112 bugs were fixed.

Highlights
----------

- Runtime performance counters have been integrated into the profiler allowing the performance counter information to be surfaced to profiling tools and in particular in Xamarin's upcoming profiler.
- The profiler now produces backtrace for statistical mode. tracing mode now works on arm.
- Big refactoring on the class library build. We're now much closer to having it build on windows without cygwin.
- We now distribute `nuget` on mac.

Debugger
--------

- It now support line and column ranges. `pdb2mdb` supports it.
- It now supports for changing the current line in the top frame.
- Lots of bugfixes and performance improvements.
- The debugger now support reading simple properties without calling their getter, this is done by having a lightweight IL interpreter for small pieces of code.   This allows more properties to be inspected while the process is completely stopped and without having to temporarily resume execution of the target to execute the property code).
- Added buffered response mode to improve network efficiency on high latency links such as USB.

GC
--

The GC bridge got a lot of performance work. There are now two new modes that can significantly improve some workloads.

Class libraries
---------------

- Multiple http stack improvements: some leaks in the stack have been fixed, as well as solving some long-standing bugs involving asynchronous operations and proxies.  We have introduced a more comprehensive test harness to ensure that those bugs do not surface again.
- System.IO.Compression is now implemented
- System.Security.Claims is now implemented. It resides in the <tt>System</tt> assembly (existed before in the Identity stack, but now we track the new home from the .NET 4.5 API).

Performance
-----------

-   Reworked locking to drop a hot lock in method lookup.
-   Use fine grained locking instead of a big hot lock.
-   Better hashing of some runtime internal items to avoid some corner-case slowdowns with generics.

Profiler
--------

- It now produces backtraces in statistical mode.
- Added periodical flushing that should help interactive users. This means that the profiling will send data over the profiling even if the application is not currently sending data (this is there to support the upcoming new profiler UI).
- It now collects and reports performance counter information. See `mprof-report`.

Misc
----

- Fixed the handling of the volatile. CIL prefix.
- We now distribute `ikdasm`.  This is a reliable disassembler that does not have the limitation of `monodis` of requiring a complete set of assemblies that are compatible to disassemble.  This will disassemble even files that do not have their dependencies available.
- Optimized EqualityComparer for more types.
- Mono.Unix.Native.Syscall.getxattr() can now return Errno.ENOATTR on OS X.
- Our `msbuild` implementation can now build Project K and Roslyn
- Optimized `EqualityComparer` for more types.
