Beta
====

Mono is a portable and open source implementation of the .NET framework for Unix, Windows, MacOS and other operating systems.

Mono 2.10.8.1 is a beta release and update to the Mono 2.10.7 Beta, which was used mostly as a vehicle to test the upcoming Gtk+ stack on MacOS X. Mono 2.10.8.1 fixes stability and packaging issues with 2.10.7 and was released as a beta for MacOS X on December 19, 2011.

If you want a stable release, use Mono [Release Notes Mono 2.10.8](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.8 "Release Notes Mono 2.10.8").

Mono 2.10.8.1 is a minor update to [Mono 2.10](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.0/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10"), [Mono 2.10.1](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.1/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10.1"), [Mono 2.10.2](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.2/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10.2"), [Mono 2.10.3](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.3/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10.3"), [2.10.4](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.4/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10.4"), [2.10.5](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.5/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10.5"), [2.10.6](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.6/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10.6"), and [2.10.7](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.7/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10.7").

Differences Between Stable and Beta
===================================

The difference between the Stable release (2.10.8) and the Beta (2.10.8.1) is that the Beta ships with an updated Gtk+ stack that has been developed with Lanedo to bring many bug fixes to Gtk+ on MacOS X.

The 2.10.8.1 release is a MacOS-only release.

MacOS Updates
=============

This release bundles the new version of Gtk+ 2 that has been fine tuned for MacOS X and fixes hundreds of problems that have been reported by users of MonoDevelop on Mac. In addition, it adds support for Lion's Smooth Scrolling.

Changes
=======

-   Revert Pango to 1.28.4 to resolve a crash when opening the MonoDevelop about box on Snow Leopard.
-   Fix a libgdiplus issue that had forced linking against Apple's X11 stack for text rendering.
-   Fix issue where a native crash causes MonoDevelop to hang and neither Force Quit nor kill -9 would terminate it (Xamarin \#2548).
-   Fix sgen failing with Assertion at sgen-gc.c:2506, condition \`mono\_sgen\_need\_bridge\_processing ()' not met.

See the [Mono 2.10.7 release notes](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.7/ "Release Notes Mono 2.10.7") for a full list of Mono changes since the last stable release.
