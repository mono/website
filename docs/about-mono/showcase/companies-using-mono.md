<!-- -->

    We launched a job board at www.agentka.cz in November 2008.
    The site runs on a Linux box and it uses Mono (currently we use version 1.9.1,
    but an upgrade is planned). The interesting thing is we do not use ASP.NET or
    Apache. The site is using a custom web server which was written in C# and also
    the web application is using a custom C# framework. The performance of the
    whole system (including full-text indexing) is really good when comparing to
    "standard" LAMP solutions.
