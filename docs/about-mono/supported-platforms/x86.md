Mono is most tuned for execution on x86 machines. Supported platforms:

-   Linux
-   Windows
-   BSD*
-   Solaris/x86

*Requires a modern version for proper thread support

Mono on x86 supports both Just-in-Time (JIT) and Ahead-of-Time ([AOT](/docs/advanced/aot/)) compilation, the latter producing Position Independent Code (PIC).

x86 Specific Optimizations
==========================

Mono is able to take advantage of Thread Local Storage (TLS) on systems that support it. It can also apply peephole optimizations to generated instructions.
