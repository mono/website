The Mono runtime has been ported to the Android OS.

The [Xamarin Platform](http://xamarin.com/platform) is the edition of
Mono for Android that provides access to all of the native Android
APIs.  It is available both as part of Microsoft Visual Studio, or as
an open source project - coming soon to [Evolve 2016](https://evolve.xamarin.com/). 

Please visit the [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) site for more information on Mono/.NET on Android.
