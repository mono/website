Mono for PlayStation®4 allows developers to build native applications and
games in C# utilizing the comprehensive set of .NET APIs including support for
.NET Standard 2. Thanks to Mono's embedding API managed .NET code can easily
be linked into native C/C++ games, e.g. as a scripting engine for game logic.

The Mono for PlayStation®4 port is a free product but only accessible to
