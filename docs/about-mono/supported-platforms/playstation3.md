The Mono runtime runs on the PLAYSTATION®3 3 with Linux.

A version of Mono for the native PLAYSTATION®3 operating system is under development but no times are available yet.

For users interested in using Mono on the PLAYSTATION®3 with the native operating system a license can be obtained from Novell. You must be a registered Sony PLAYSTATION®3 Developer.

Both the Mono runtime and the Mono C# Compiler are available under proprietary license for those who cannot, or choose not to, use LGPL and GPL code in their projects.
