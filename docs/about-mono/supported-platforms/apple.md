The Mono runtime has been ported to iOS, tvOS and watchOS.

The [Xamarin Platform](http://xamarin.com/platform) is the edition of
Mono for  iOS, tvOS and watchOS that provides access to all of the
native iOS APIs. It is available both as part of Microsoft Visual Studio, or as
an open source project - coming soon to [Evolve 2016](https://evolve.xamarin.com/).

Please visit the [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) site for more information on Mono/.NET on iOS, tvOS and watchOS.
