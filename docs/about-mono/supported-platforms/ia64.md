The IA64 port is at the same level as the x86/amd64 ports. Currently, only linux is supported.

The port was started by Zoltan Varga in May 2005 and completed in August of the same year.

## Building Mono on IA64

In addition to the usual mono dependencies, it depends on the libunwind package to implement exception handling:

[http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/](http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/)

By default, the mono GC is configured to use 8KB pages, which will not work on IA64 machines with a 4KB page size. To check the page size on your system, type:

zcat /proc/config.gz | grep PAGE_SIZE_4KB

If this prints something like this:

CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_4KB=y

then mono needs to be compiled with a compiler flag to use 4KB pages:

configure "CFLAGS=-DHBLKSIZE=4096"

A runtime compiled this way will work on machines using both 4KB and 8KB pages.
