title: Mono 1.0.6 Release Notes
---

For detailed information about Mono, please see the [Mono 1.0](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0/) release notes.

Mono 1.0.6 is a maintenance release release for the 1.0 series of the Mono runtime. The Mono 1.0.xx series is the edition of stable releases of the Mono runtime.

At this point, users looking for extra performance, scalability and features should use Mono 1.1.4.

Although we will continue to maintain the 1.0.x branch of Mono, at this point we recommend that users switch their runtime to Mono 1.1.4. There are also more binary packages available for the Mono 1.1.4 distribution that Mono 1.0.6

New In Mono 1.0.6
-----------------

There are many bug fixes, optimizations and scalability fixes that have been backported from the Mono 1.1.xx releases, but in addition:

### MonoDoc

Updated documentation all around: monkeyguide, Gtk\#.

Monodocer from Joshua is the new documentation update tool, to use it, just use the `monodocer` command on your assemblies.

Monodoc now can convert the output of the C\# compiler -doc switch into ECMA XML documentation, so you can browse it with monodoc (command line option --cs-to-ecma).

Atsushi ported monodoc's ASP.NET interface so it works on Windows now.

### XSP server and mod\_mono

Many bug fixes to the XSP server: Better pathinfo support, connection handling bug fixes.

Until now, if you were running apache 2 using a MPM model other than prefork, you needed some tricks to make mod\_mono work. That's over. Thanks to a patch by Rob Lyon mod\_mono is able to start mod-mono-server without any problem on any MPM model.

### Gtk\# 1.0.6

An updated version of Gtk\# which fixes a few memory leaks and reduces considerably the size of Gtk\#.
