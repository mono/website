Stack Overflow
--------------

Stack Overflow is a popular Q&A site where users can [ask questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) about software development, including Mono. Many Mono contributors and community members actively answer [Stack Overflow questions tagged mono](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mono), so make sure your questions have the mono tag.

The primary discussion forum for Mono community members and Mono team members at Novell are the [Mono mailing lists]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/Mailing_Lists "Mailing Lists").

If you prefer a forums interface, you can interact with other Mono users and developers through the [Forums]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/Forums "Forums") interface to our mailing lists.
