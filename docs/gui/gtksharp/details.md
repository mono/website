Gtk# 2.0 has been released.

Introduction
------------

[![IFolder_Linux.png](/archived/images/5/57/IFolder_Linux.png)](/archived/images/5/57/IFolder_Linux.png)

iFolder, a [GTK#](/docs/gui/gtksharp/) application

Gtk#, a [GUI Toolkit](/docs/gui/gui-toolkits/), is a set of .NET bindings for the [gtk+](http://www.gtk.org/) toolkit and assorted [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) libraries. This library allows you to build fully native graphical Gnome application using Mono. GTK# is an event-driven system like any other modern windowing library. Every widget in an application has handler methods that get called when particular events happen.

Applications built using Gtk# will run on many platforms including Linux, Windows and MacOS X. Gtk is the native toolkit for the Linux desktop running GNOME, so applications will look and function best on here. The Mono packages for Windows include Gtk, Gtk# and the native theme to make your applications look like native Windows applications. At this point, running Gtk# applications on MacOS requires the user to run the X11 server.

You can use [Glade](http://glade.gnome.org/) along with the Glade# bindings to easily design GUI applications. A new GUI designer called [Stetic](/archived/stetic) is being built which will be integrated with the MonoDevelop IDE.

In addition to support the standard Gtk/Gnome stack of development tools, the gtk-dotnet.dll assembly provides a bridge to consume functionality available on the .NET stack, at this point this includes the functionality to use System.Drawing to draw on a widget.

See the sample in gtk-sharp/samples/DrawingSample.cs for details.

User Testimonials
-----------------

User testimonials indicate that Gtk# provides developers with great productivity for building graphical applications especially when compared to GTK+ or Java SwingÂ : *"Gtk# and Mono have proven to be an outstanding combination for delivering rich client applications to the Linux desktop...Gtk# and Mono's tight integration with the GNOME/Ximian desktop enables us to deliver desktop plugins written entirely in managed code. Today, this level of integration is not possible on Windows with .NET and Windows Forms."* says Brady Anderson from the [iFolder](http://www.ifolder.com) project.

Additional Widgets
------------------

The following is a list of additional widgets (known as "controls" in Windows) that people have written to extend Gtk#:

-   [DiaCanvas#](http://diacanvas.sourceforge.net/csharp.php) - Create and display diagrams and flowcharts
-   [GtkGL#](http://www.olympum.com/~bruno/gtkgl-sharp.html) - OpenGL and Gtk# integration. Not maintained.
-   [GtkGLAreaSharp](/archived/gtkglareasharp) - OpenGL widget, based on the [GtkGLArea](/archived/gtkglarea) widget. Currently maintained by CJCollier.

Availability: [Web](https://github.com/mono/hal-sharp/) [snapshot](https://github.com/mono/hal-sharp/archive/master.zip).

#### DBus Sharp

#### JScall Sharp

JSCall is a simple JavaScript bridge for Gecko#. It's an interim solution until someone writes a proper XPCOM bridge for Mono, and uses unmanaged code and P/Invoke to invoke Gecko's XPCOM components from managed code. It should work with any .NET language, but I've referred to C# for simplicity. I don't expect many people to use this, so the documentation is little more than minimal; lease contact me \<m.j.hutchinson@gmail.com\> if you need help working out how it works.

Availability: [Web](https://github.com/mono/jscall-sharp/) [snapshot](https://github.com/mono/jscall-sharp/archive/master.zip)

Now the wrapper of version 0.9.9.2 has just an NPlot upgrade and a few hacks over the work of Miguel (Carlos)

This version of NPlot has been extended to support Gtk# on Linux.

The version is based on NPlot 0.9.9.2 Availability: [Web](https://github.com/mono/nplot-gtk/) [snapshot](https://github.com/mono/nplot-gtk/archive/master.zip).
