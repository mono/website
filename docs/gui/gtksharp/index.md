What is Gtk#?
--------------

Gtk# is a Graphical User Interface Toolkit for mono and .Net. The project binds the [gtk+](http://www.gtk.org/) toolkit and assorted [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) libraries, enabling fully native graphical Gnome application development using the Mono and .Net development frameworks.
