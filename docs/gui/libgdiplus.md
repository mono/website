Libgdiplus is the Mono library that provides a GDI+-compatible API on non-Windows operating systems. Our implementation uses [Cairo](http://www.cairographics.org) to do most of the heavy lifting.

Mono's implementation of GDI+ lives in the [libgdiplus GitHub repository](https://github.com/mono/libgdiplus).

See [here](/docs/gui/problemgdiplusinit/) if you're having problems initializing libgdiplus.

Plans
=====

Due to its tight relation with System.Drawing, new versions of libgdiplus are released with (almost) every new version of Mono.

Text
----

The current custom text engine is limited. GDI+ offers many (little used) options that are not, or incorrectly, supported by libgdiplus. The plan is to use Pango to replace our custom engineâ€”but no work is being done on this task at the moment.

A *proof-of-concept* is already in Git but is **unsupported** and less complete than the current text engine. You can use **--with-pango** to enable it.

Other Tasks
-----------

Cairo doesn't provide 100% of the functionalities required to implement GDI+ or System.Drawing. A few features were added directly in libgdiplus (unmanaged) or System.Drawing (managed).

However some features are still missing, check the [TODO](https://github.com/mono/libgdiplus/blob/master/TODO) file in the repository. Contributions toward completing those tasks are welcome.
