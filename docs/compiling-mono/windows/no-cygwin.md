Mono on Windows can be built using Visual Studio only toolchain. You will need the latest version of Visual Studio 2017.

If you encounter issues you may want to build using [the older Cygwin+Visual Studio process](/docs/compiling-mono/windows/).

## Prerequisites

* Enable `Developer Mode` in the Windows 10 Settings app (Update & Security -> For developers tab)
* Install [Visual Studio 2017 or later](https://www.visualstudio.com) - Community Edition works fine. If it is already installed, use the `Visual Studio Installer` to ensure you have the latest updates.
* Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and enable use of it from cmd with the `Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt` option in the installer.

Make sure that the following GIT setting is set to avoid issues with line endings:

`git config --global core.autocrlf input`

## Build Mono 64-bit using Visual Studio Command Prompt

The mono runtime, standard library and tools can all currently be built using Visual Studio. Building and running tests will still require the use of Cygwin and Bash, which you can see described in the [Cygwin build documentation](/docs/compiling-mono/windows/).

You will need to run the build commands inside a Visual Studio command prompt - the shortcut to open one for VS2017 is called `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017`, and you can find it in your `Visual Studio Tools` folder in the start menu (or by typing `Native Tools` into Cortana).
Note that in the commands below we explicitly specify the `net_4_x` platform when building the standard library. This is because the standard library can be built for multiple platforms (like Android or OS X) so there is no universal default option. We also specify the use of the SGEN garbage collector instead of Boehm, because Boehm is not supported on 64-bit Windows. `/restore` is used when building the standard library because of a dependency on a NuGet package.
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/mono/mono.git
cd mono
git submodule update --init --recursive
msbuild msvc\mono.sln /p:MONO_TARGET_GC=sgen
msbuild bcl.sln /p:Platform="net_4_x" /restore
```

Multiprocess builds can be performed by passing the `/m` switch to msbuild, but in practice they may not be much faster than a single-process build.

## Build Mono 64-bit using Visual Studio

Follow the git commands above, then open `msvc\mono.sln` in Visual Studio 2017. Ensure you do not open it in an older version you might have installed, like 2013 or 2015. Select the platform and configuration you prefer (x86, x64, etc.) and then build.
After this, open bcl.sln in VS2017, select the `net_4_x` platform, and build.

Please be aware that current builds of Visual Studio 2017 are prone to crashing while bcl.sln is open.
