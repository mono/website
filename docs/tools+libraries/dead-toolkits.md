The following toolkits are no longer under active development.

Sharp WT
--------

Homepage: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpdevelop](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpdevelop)

This is a project started by the developers of SharpDevelop.

The project started due to the limitations on Windows.Forms and the need to port their large application to Linux. They picked the SWT toolkit which is part of Eclipse and ported it from Java to C#.

SWT uses native widgets on each one of its target platforms, so the look and feel matches the underlying operating system.

Pros:

-   Native look and feel on various platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS).
-   Clean design.
-   The Java version has been successfully used by the Eclipse project.

Cons:

-   Little or no documentation.
-   Authoring new widgets is either hard (due to testing on multiple platforms), or the look and feel is unique.
-   Still under heavy development.
-   Common denominator subset API problem.

Qt#

QT# Sample

Homepage: [http://qtcsharp.sourceforge.net/](http://qtcsharp.sourceforge.net/)

THIS PROJECT IS DEAD. DEVELOPMENT HAS STOPPED BECAUSE OF LACK OF INTEREST.

This is a binding to the Qt toolkit. This toolkit used to be under development, but its development has pretty much stopped.

Pros:

-   Native look and feel on each platform.

Cons:

-   Toolkit is licensed under the GPL, and the Qt substrate has further licensing limitations. It is not suitable for proprietary or non-GPL development.
-   Binding is unmaintained.
-   Currently its layered on top of the C binding to Qt.

wxNet
-----

[![Linux-05.png](/archived/images/c/cf/Linux-05.png)](/archived/images/c/cf/Linux-05.png)

wx# Sample

Homepage: [[http://wxnet.sourceforge.net/](http://wxnet.sourceforge.net/)]

wxNet is a .NET binding for the wxWindows cross-platform toolkit.

Pros:

-   Native look and feel on each platform.
-   Substrate (wxWindows) is well documented, .NET binding lacks documentation.

Cons:

-   Binding to non-supported extra widgets is hard.
-   Custom-authored widgets look and feel is not preserved across platforms.
-   Common denominator subset API problem.

Gaia Ajax Widgets
-----------------

[Gaia Ajax Widgets](http://ajaxwidgets.com/more/about_gaia_ajax_framework/mono_support.aa) was built to mimic 100% the logic of conventional ASP.NET and basically this means that if you know ASP.NET you know how to use Gaia Ajax Widgets! Gaia Ajax Web Widgets does not have ANY cryptic properties or code model you need to learn before you can use Gaia effectively, almost none of our controls uses any other properties than the ones that comes with native ASP.NET so if you know your way around ASP.NET you know your way around Gaia! This can be seen from the fact that you don't need to use WebServices to e.g. populate our AutoCompleter and from the event that retrieves the AutoComplete data you can do whatever you like, including for instance making a DropDownList visible or showing a modal window.

Gaia AjaxWidgets provides Mono support.

Qyoto
-----

Homepage: [Qyoto](http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Languages/Qyoto)

The Qyoto/Kimono languages bindings allow C# and any other .NET language to be used to write Qt/KDE programs. The bindings are autogenerated directly from the Qt/KDE headers, greatly reducing the maintenance effort. KDE doxygen comments are automatically converted to the xml based C# style of comment format. Substrate is well documented and supported. Qyoto 4.0 documentation can be found [here](http://api.kde.org/qyoto-api/).

Platforms: Unix, Windows, macOS

On Debian/Ubuntu, it can be acquired by installing the 'qyoto-dev' package.

Qt4Dotnet
---------

Homepage: [Qt4Dotnet](http://code.google.com/p/qt4dotnet/)

This is a port of the QtJambi java bindings to .NET using IKVM.
